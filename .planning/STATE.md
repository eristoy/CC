# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-25)

**Core value:** Ableton projects are always protected across multiple locations — set it up once and never lose work again.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Backup Engine

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Backup Engine)
Plan: 1 of 5 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-25 — Completed plan 01-01 (GRDB schema + persistence foundation)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 4% (1 of 25 total plans estimated)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 6 min
- Total execution time: 0.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-backup-engine | 1/5 complete | 6 min | 6 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (6 min)
- Trend: —

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Swift 6 + SwiftUI MenuBarExtra + GRDB.swift confirmed as stack (research phase)
- Distribute outside Mac App Store initially — sandbox restrictions conflict with FSEvents bookmarks and NetFS
- GitHub/Git LFS destination ships last (Phase 6) — highest complexity, narrowest audience
- **[01-01]** xxHash-Swift 1.1.1 resolved successfully — included (no CryptoKit fallback needed)
- **[01-01]** makeInMemory() uses temp-file DatabasePool (not :memory:) — WAL mode requires real file path
- **[01-01]** VersionStatus defined in separate file for clean imports across modules
- **[01-01]** ProjectResolver.swift stub created — satisfies compilation of plan 01-02 TDD RED test file

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 2**: Sandboxing decision must be finalized before implementation (affects FSEvents bookmark handling)
- **Phase 2**: Concurrent job limit policy needed when multiple watch folders change simultaneously
- **Phase 4**: iCloud large file throttling behavior at scale needs validation (5-20 GB projects)
- **Phase 4**: macOS 15 NetFS reconnection behavior needs validation during planning
- **Phase 5**: ALS XML schema should be validated against real Ableton 11 and 12 projects before implementation
- **Phase 6**: GitHub LFS quota UX (1 GB free tier vs. multi-GB audio) needs design before implementation
